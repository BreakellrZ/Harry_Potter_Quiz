# Harry Potter Spell Game

[Link to the live project here](https://breakellrz.github.io/Harry_Potter_Quiz/)

- Harry Potter's Spell Game is a game based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. It is the same principle and has the same rules. Certain spells beat other spells. In this game you are in a battle arena and are against Draco Malfoy the charachter in the Harry Potter movies. The background image is an AI image of Hogwarts. The website has three pages, 'Home', 'Rules', and 'Battle arena'. The 'Home' page consists of a start and rules button, along with a input field for users to put in their username. The 'Rules' page consists of all the rules to the game, along with a back button to the 'Home' page. The 'Game Arena' consists of pressable buttons for the user to choose which spell he is going to use against the computer (Draco), a score section to show the user who is winning the battle, and a 'Home' button to return the user back to the main 'Home' screen. The game is completely random just like Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. It is based of luck, but I hope the users have more fun with it because of the Harry Potter theme. To win the user has to reach a score of 10 before the computer (Draco) or else the user will lose and the scores will be reset. There is an audio button in the footer for users to get immersed into the game more with some magical music.
